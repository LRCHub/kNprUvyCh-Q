In the neighborhood
Sounds of kids at play
Just another ordinary day
Jumping double dutch
Out on the street
Deja says "hey"
Can you feel the beat?

Boys playing ball
Steam rises off the concrete
Kids under water spray
Open hydrant on the street
Games like
Kick the can
Capture the flag
Green eggs and ham

Trading cards
Spinning tops
Spaceships made
From a cardboard box
Steering wheel
From a pizza pan
Just can't' wait to see
Where we will land

Skip to my lou, Skip to my lou

Capture the flag
Green eggs and ham
